# Contributing

There are lot of ways to contribute to the workbook platform. You can write documentation, or create issues sharpening our roadmap 

# Want to code with us ?
The project is built with rails 7 and follow most of the established patterns for developing rails applications. We add a general service layer to the controllers so that they stay skinny. All services must return a success or error object that can hold additional data. We use docker and docker compose to develop locally so that it's easy to get started. 

# Below are the steps to boot the application with docker
- run `make build_base_images`
- run make start guard if you want to go the tdd way 
- run make start dev and start hacking the code

# Have sometime to review a merge request
You have some dev/ops skills and are able to help an open source project move forward, we need reviewers to keep our codebase in quality standards that match the industry.

# Want to help document the project
Yes we need multilingual people who can document and translate the platform wording.
